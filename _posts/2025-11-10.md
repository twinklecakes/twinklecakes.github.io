## Hello World and Welcome!

I'm hurling this blog into the cyber-void as a space to share my thoughts, observations, and insights on the myriad of things I'm passionate about, among them: **nature**, **storytelling**, and **untangling complex problems**.

### Why This Blog?

I'm trying a new thing! This is the test blog entry. I would love to keep track of what I'm thinking about, and my growth process of self-identity and academic pursuits.

### What You'll Find Here

#### Nature Musings

I'll be sharing observations from the natural world - from the intricate ecosystems to the simple beauty of a sun-smelt stroll 

#### Blips in my Life

Get a lil' window into my mind as I navigate the world, journey from here to there, and find out tidbits about myself and the broader world's machinations

#### Project Adventures

I'll try to keep track of different projects I work on, and what comes of them... whoop-de-doop, maybe they will prove interesting at a passing glance

### Let's Connect

Have thoughts on what I've shared? Curious about a particular topic? I'd love to hear from you at [avelyn@stanford.edu](mailto:avelyn@stanford.edu).
