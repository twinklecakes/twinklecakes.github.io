personal website @ avelynb.com 
<br> just a hosting platform to push to my domain name
<br> just trying something new here
<br> just me maintaining and committing
<br> just me reaping the project benefits so far
<br> it really bears full honesty here to note I used Claude for most of this, using it to speed up the process of making all these nesting matryoshka dolls of divs and smoothing over the CSS files and hyding my ignorance of Jekyll integration :)
